every patient and the staff automatically. Our system is divided into three
parts namely the Receptionist, the Doctor and the Administrator.

Receptionist will be responsible for registering the patient, he/she can also
view the basic information about the employees and the patient.
Doctors can add/view the patient history along with the status of the patient
being admitted or not for a specific duration. Doctors can also check his/her
records.

deleting an employee to adding one. Entire information of the hospital will
be made available to the administrator.
