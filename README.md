# Patient-Management-System-for-Hospital

## Aim of the project

The aim of the project is to develop a database management system that is meant to computerize the work of a hospital such as keeping track of patient appointments, schedule of doctors and nurses, and information of all the employees, along with maintaing the integrity and security of data. 

## About the project

The project Hospital Management system includes registration of patients,
storing their details into the system along with their history. The software
has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and store the details of
every patient and the staff automatically. Our system is divided into three
parts namely the Receptionist, the Doctor and the Administrator.

Receptionist will be responsible for registering the patient, he/she can also
view the basic information about the employees and the patient.

Doctors can view patient details regarding their past visits, medication and doctors they have consulted. They can also store their current details in patient history for future reference.

Administrator will be the head of the system including all the rights from
deleting an employee to adding one. Entire information of the hospital will
be made available to the administrator, except for the details present in *patient history*.
